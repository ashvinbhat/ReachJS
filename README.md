# ReachJS

ReachJS is a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It aims to provide outreach to small scale vendors who find it difficult to market their shops and get customers.

## Getting Started

To run the web application, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `https://github.com/ashvinbhat/ReachJS.git`
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory: `cd reach-js`
3. Install the dependencies for the backend by running: `cd backend && npm install`
4. Install the dependencies for the frontend by running: `cd ../frontend && npm install`

### Usage

1. Start the MongoDB server by running: `mongod`
2. In a new terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the `backend` directory and start the Node.js server by running: `npm start`
3. In another new terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the `frontend` directory and start the React.js development server by running: `npm start`
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the web application.

### Features
