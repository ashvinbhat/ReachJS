          <p>1) Who can register?</p>
          <p>Absolutely anyone, as long as you have a product to sell and a passion to grow.</p>
          <p>2) How many categories can I register under my company</p>
          <p>As many as you would like :)</p>
          <p>3) How long would it take to display my products after registering</p>
        </div>
        <i>For Buyers</i>
        <div className="qsns">
          <p>1) How do I know if the seller is verified?</p>
          <p>We at ReachJS make sure to verify while the vendors are registering thus eliminating the chance of an illegitimate seller.</p>
          <p>2) I live in Pune, does this work outside bangalore as well?</p>
          <p>We are yet to expand to other cities but it is for sure under development</p>
